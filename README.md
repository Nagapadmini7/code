# Simple Rust-Based Smart Contract using Anchor Framework

This repository contains a simple Rust-based smart contract implemented using the Anchor framework. The smart contract includes functionality to mint a new SPL token and transfer this token between two accounts.

## Smart Contract Code

The smart contract code can be found in the `src/lib.rs` file.

## Deploying the Smart Contract

To deploy the smart contract on a local Solana testnet, follow these steps:

1.Ensure you have the necessary prerequisites installed, including Rust, Solana CLI, and Anchor CLI.

2.Clone this repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/Nagapadmini7/catoff.git`

3.Navigate to the project directory: `cd code`

4.Build the smart contract code: `anchor build`

5. Deploy the smart contract to the local Solana testnet: `anchor deploy`

6.Once deployed, note down the program ID generated by Anchor.

## Testing the Smart Contract

To test the functionality of the smart contract, you can write tests using the Anchor framework. Refer to the tests directory for examples of test cases.

1.Run the tests: `anchor test`

2.Review the test results to ensure the smart contract behaves as expected.
